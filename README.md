# React Native Third-Party Library Integration Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked issue in React Native development: errors stemming from improper integration of third-party libraries.

The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where an attempt to use a third-party library results in an error due to an incomplete or incorrect integration.  The nature of the error will vary depending on the library involved, and may include runtime exceptions, missing modules, or undefined methods.  The specific error message is crucial for debugging.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, showing the proper steps to integrate the third-party library and resolve the issue. This will usually involve correctly installing the library, linking any necessary native modules (if applicable), and ensuring all required dependencies are met.

**Key takeaways:**
* Always carefully follow the installation instructions for third-party libraries.
* Double-check that all native dependencies are linked, especially on Android.
* Inspect the error messages carefully; they often point directly to the root cause.
* Consider using a package manager like npm or yarn for consistent dependency management.
