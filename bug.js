This error occurs when using a third-party library that's not correctly integrated into your React Native project. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes during runtime. For instance, if a library relies on native modules that aren't properly linked, you might see an error related to missing modules or methods.

Example:
```javascript
import { SomeThirdPartyLibrary } from 'some-third-party-library';

// ... later in your code
const result = await SomeThirdPartyLibrary.someMethod(); // This might throw an error if the library isn't correctly linked.
```
